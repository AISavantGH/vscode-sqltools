# Support new Drivers

Starting on v0.22, drivers are VSCode extensions as well. They plug into SQLTools to become available for usage

To create a new driver, first, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-sqltools-driver using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-sqltools-driver
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo sqltools-driver
```
